A repository containing the data and programs for studying CRISPR-Cas and AMR genes in healthcare-related pathogens

To download/visualize identified CRISPR-Cas systems, please go to <a href="https://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/CRISPRone/pathogen/">CRISPRone</a> website.

What's included in this repository:

* Data
  * tables/*: tables showing the presence of CRISPR-Cas systems and the number of predicted AMR genes in the different isolates of each species
  * data/amrplus_eskape.csv.gz: predicted AMR genes in all pathogen isolates

* Programs
  * CRISPR-AMR-test.ipynb: a python notebook for statistical testing if CRISPR-Cas containing isolates tend to have fewer AMR genes
  * lib/build_spacer2mge_network.py: script that takes spacer blast outputs and spacer cdhit outputs and constructs a MGE:spacer network

* Example: build MGE:spacer network
