A repository containing the data and programs for studying CRISPR-Cas and AMR genes in healthcare-related pathogens

To download/visualize identified CRISPR-Cas systems, please go to <a href="https://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/CRISPRone/pathogen/">CRISPRone</a> website.

Data included in this repository:
tables/*: tables showing the presence of CRISPR-Cas systems and the number of predicted AMR genes in the different isolates of each species
data/amrplus_eskape.csv.gz: predicted AMR genes in all pathogen isolates 

Programs included in this repository
CRISPR-AMR-test.ipynb: a python notebook for statistical testing if CRISPR-Cas containing isolates tend to have fewer AMR genes
